* Introduction
** Project description

Periodically send reminders to friends/colleagues until they decide it is time
to help you with whatever you requested them...or until you lose their
friendship...

Users should be able to send reminders via email at least, other kind of
receivers such as IM systems, SMS, mobile or other forms of notifications
could be added in the future.

The frequency of the reminder should be configurable by the user that creates
it; it should be possible to disable the reminder manually (both by the receiver
and the creator) or automatically by integrating with third party notification
systems.

To create a reminder a user should be logged in in the system but to mark a
reminder as completed (or acknowledged) a user might only need a "magic link",
received in a notification generated by the reminder; this needs to be like that
because recipients of reminder notifications may not be logged in or even
registered in the platform.
